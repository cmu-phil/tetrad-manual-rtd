# Tetrad Manual

Welcome to the official documentation for **Tetrad**, the open-source platform for causal discovery, causal inference, simulation, and graph-based statistical reasoning developed at Carnegie Mellon University.

Tetrad provides:

- A **graphical user interface (GUI)** for interactive causal modeling
- A comprehensive **Java library** with search algorithms, scores, and independence tests
- **Python and R bindings** (Py-Tetrad and RPy-Tetrad)
- A flexible architecture for extending algorithms, adding custom tests, and integrating new workflows

This site is the **Read the Docs** version of the Tetrad manual, reorganized into small, navigable sections for ease of use.

## 🚀 What is Tetrad?

Tetrad is a suite of tools for:

- Discovering causal structure from observational or experimental data
- Estimating causal effects
- Simulating data from DAGs, MAGs, and SEMs
- Working with DAGs, CPDAGs, MAGs, PAGs, and other causal graph types
- Performing score-based, constraint-based, and hybrid causal search

The system has been under active development for nearly 30 years and includes many of the most widely used and theoretically grounded causal discovery methods.

## 🧭 Start Here — Core User Workflows

Most users interact with Tetrad through a simple pipeline:

### 1. **Load or simulate data**
- Continuous, discrete, or mixed datasets
- SEM-based generators
- Nonlinear and non-Gaussian options
- Resampling and bootstrapping tools

### 2. **Specify prior knowledge (optional)**
- Required or forbidden edges
- Tier/background knowledge
- Selection variables

### 3. **Run a causal search algorithm**
Choose among:
- **Constraint-based** (PC, FCI, PC-Max, RFCI…)
- **Score-based** (FGES, BOSS, GRaSP…)
- **Hybrid** (GFCI, BOSS-FCI, FCIT…)
- **Specialized** (LiNGAM, CAM, NOTEARS, LASSO variants, ANM models)

### 4. **Inspect and modify the resulting graph**
- Orient edges
- Add/remove adjacencies
- Run legality checks
- Compare graphs side-by-side

### 5. **Estimate causal effects**
- Adjustment sets
- IDA-style estimation (including PAG IDA)
- Efficiency-oriented and path-specific tools

Each of these steps is documented in the sections linked below.

## 🔧 Using Tetrad Programmatically

Tetrad can also be used outside the GUI through its programmatic interfaces  
(Java, Python, and R). Rather than duplicating links here, we refer you to the  
**official Tetrad website**, which always contains up-to-date links to:

- Java Javadocs
- Py-Tetrad (Python interface)
- RPy-Tetrad (R interface)
- Tutorials and example scripts
- Download pages

See:

### Related Python Ecosystem Tools

The Python ecosystem also includes **causal-learn**, a well-supported project that  
implements several Tetrad-style algorithms natively in Python, together with  
additional methods and utilities tailored to the Python community:

Tetrad and causal-learn share common theoretical foundations and can be used  
side-by-side depending on your workflow, programming environment, and performance needs.

# Tetrad Manual

Welcome to the official documentation for **Tetrad**, the open-source platform for causal discovery, causal inference, simulation, and graph-based statistical reasoning developed at Carnegie Mellon University.

Tetrad provides:

- A **graphical user interface (GUI)** for interactive causal modeling
- A comprehensive **Java library** with search algorithms, scores, and independence tests
- **Python and R bindings** (Py-Tetrad and RPy-Tetrad)
- A flexible architecture for extending algorithms, adding custom tests, and integrating new workflows

This site is the **Read the Docs** version of the Tetrad manual, reorganized into small, navigable sections for ease of use.

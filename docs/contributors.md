# Contributors

Tetrad has been under active development for more than three decades. It began in
the Philosophy Department at Carnegie Mellon University and has evolved through
the sustained work of faculty, graduate students, postdocs, software engineers,
and collaborators across several institutions. This page acknowledges the major
contributors whose work has shaped Tetrad into the platform it is today.

## 🌟 Founders & Early Leadership

Tetrad originated under the direction of:

- **Clark Glymour** — Philosophy, Carnegie Mellon University
- **Peter Spirtes** — Philosophy, Carnegie Mellon University
- **Richard Scheines** — Philosophy, Carnegie Mellon University

Their work established foundational theory in causal discovery, including the PC,
FCI, and GES algorithms (with Chris Meek), as well as the causal graph formalisms used throughout
the platform.

## 🧭 Project Direction & Architecture

The long-standing **lead architect and principal developer** of Tetrad is:

- **Joseph Ramsey** — Carnegie Mellon University

Joe has overseen the evolution of Tetrad from its early Java prototype to the
modern multi-language ecosystem (Java, Python, R), and is the primary author of
many recent algorithms, scores, tests, and infrastructure components.

Scientific direction and collaborative leadership have also come from:

- **Greg Cooper** — University of Pittsburgh
- **Kun Zhang** — Carnegie Mellon University

## 🔬 Algorithmic & Research Contributions

Tetrad incorporates algorithms developed by numerous researchers, including:

- Bryan Andrews
- Ruben Sanchez-Romero
- Jiji Zhang
- Biwei Huang
- Juan Miguel Ogarrio
- Erich Kummerfeld
- Ricardo Silva
- Dan Malinsky
- David Danks
- Kevin Kelly
- Eric Strobl
- Shyam Visweswaran

- Madelyn Glymour

These contributions include PC variants, FCI/GFCI/RFCI, GRaSP, BOSS, Fast Causal
Inference Tests (FCIT), hybrid latent-variable methods, IDA variants, RA (recursive
adjustment), O-sets, and numerous scoring and testing procedures.

Tetrad also draws on work from the broader causal discovery community, whose
algorithms and ideas are referenced throughout the manual.

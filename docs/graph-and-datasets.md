# Graphs and DataSets

Tetrad works with two fundamental classes of objects:

- **Graphs**, which represent causal structures, statistical dependencies, or constraints, and
- **DataSets**, which represent the measured or simulated data on which algorithms operate.

Understanding the available *graph types*, their *formats*, and the different *dataset formats* used throughout Tetrad is essential for using the search algorithms, performing simulations, and interpreting output.

The two pages below provide full details about how graphs and datasets are represented, stored, and used within the Tetrad ecosystem.

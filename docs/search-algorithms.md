# Search Algorithms

This section collects all **structure-learning algorithms** in Tetrad and the
documentation that goes with them. It’s organized at three levels:

- **Short list** – a curated set of recommended algorithms for most users.
- **Full catalog** – a categorized “wall of algorithms” with brief descriptions.
- **Alphabetical index** – an A–Z index of per-algorithm pages in `algorithms/`.

Use this page as your entry point into the search-algorithm documentation.

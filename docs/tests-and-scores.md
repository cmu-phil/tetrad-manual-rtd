# Tests & Scores

Causal discovery in Tetrad relies on **conditional-independence tests** (for constraint-based methods) and **scores** (for score-based or hybrid methods). Choosing the right test or score is essential to obtaining accurate and reliable graphs.

This section provides:
- A **practical guide** to choosing an appropriate test/score for your data type  
  → *Choosing Tests & Scores*
- A **catalog-style reference** summarizing all available tests and scores in Tetrad  
  → *Tests & Scores Catalog*

Use these pages together when selecting modeling assumptions for PC, FGES, BOSS, GFCI, and related algorithms.

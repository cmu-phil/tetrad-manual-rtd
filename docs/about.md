# About

Tetrad is an open-source platform for causal discovery, simulation, and causal
model analysis developed at **Carnegie Mellon University** and the **University
of Pittsburgh**. Originating in the philosophy of science and machine learning
communities, the project has grown over several decades into a comprehensive
environment for learning, evaluating, and reasoning with graphical causal
models.

This manual provides consolidated, up-to-date documentation for Tetrad’s
algorithms, graphical model representations, data formats, effect-estimation
tools, and user interfaces. It replaces and expands the older “classic” HTML
manual, incorporating modern algorithms, updated descriptions, and extensive
cross-referencing.

## 📚 Project Background

Tetrad supports a full ecosystem of causal modeling tools, including:

- DAG, CPDAG, MAG, and PAG causal graphs
- constraint-based, score-based, and hybrid search algorithms
- methods for learning with latent variables and selection bias
- effect-size estimation, adjustment sets, and path blocking
- nonlinear and non-Gaussian independence tests and scores
- simulation frameworks for linear, nonlinear, and neural-network–based SEMs
- extensive GUI tools and programmatic interfaces

In addition to the Java/GUI version, Tetrad includes modern APIs:

- **Py-Tetrad** — Python interface (with its own 2023 software paper)
- **RPy-Tetrad** — R interface via rpy2
- The core **Java library**, used both in the GUI and headless workflows.

Development is ongoing, with new algorithms and methods added as time and
resources allow. Community suggestions and contributions are welcome.

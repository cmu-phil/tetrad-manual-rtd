# About

Tetrad is an open-source platform for causal discovery, simulation, and model
analysis developed over several decades at **Carnegie Mellon University** and
the **University of Pittsburgh**. It supports a wide ecosystem of algorithms,
theoretical tools, graphical models, and data-processing methods used in both
research and applied settings.

This page provides an overview of the project and links to deeper background
materials.

## 📚 Project Background

Tetrad began as a research effort in causal inference, graphical models, and
philosophy of science. Over time, it has evolved into a large and widely used
software system supporting:

- DAG, CPDAG, MAG, and PAG causal models
- score-based, constraint-based, and hybrid search algorithms
- tools for effect estimation, adjustment sets, and path analysis
- simulation and benchmarking frameworks
- Python and R interfaces (Py-Tetrad and RPy-Tetrad)

We add new algorithms and ideas whenever time and resources allow, and we welcome 
suggestions from the community.

# User Guide

## 🏛️ The Classic Manual

Tetrad’s graphical interface has a detailed manual written in HTML, with pictures 
Until the content is fully migrated into Read the Docs, the **existing manual** 
remains the authoritative reference for the GUI layout, workflow, and tools.

You can open it here:

👉 **[Classic Tetrad Manual (HTML Preview)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https:///github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/blob/development/tetrad-lib/src/main/resources/docs/manual/index.html)**

## 📘 What the Classic Manual Contains

The HTML manual includes:

- **Overview of the Tetrad interface**  
  Data box, Knowledge box, Search box, Graph view, Simulation tools

- **How to load, inspect, and manipulate data**

- **Background knowledge editor**  
  Tiers, required/forbidden edges, selection variables

- **Search box and algorithms**  
  How to configure parameters, depth, CI tests, penalty terms, etc.

- **Graph editing tools**  
  Orient edges, remove adjacencies, check legality, export formats

- **Simulation and resampling tools**  
  SEMs, MIMs, resampling, bootstrapping

If you are new to Tetrad’s GUI, this is the best place to start.

## 🔧 Future Migration

The long-term plan is to migrate the manual into fully native Markdown pages, where you will benefit from:

- Searchable content
- Cross-references (e.g., linking algorithms ↔ parameters ↔ workflows)
- Versioned documentation
- A cleaner, more modern navigation structure

As pieces are migrated, those pages will appear here in the User Guide and eventually replace the HTML preview entirely.

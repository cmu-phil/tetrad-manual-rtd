# Tetrad Interface

[//]: # (## Overview)

This section describes the **graphical user interface (GUI)** of Tetrad: how to load data, build and edit graphs,
run search algorithms, inspect results, and use additional tools like simulation, grid search, and the Markov checker.

Tetrad’s GUI is organized around a few core ideas:

- A **project workspace** where data, graphs, and results live as nodes in a tree.
- A **main window** with tabs/panels for editing graphs, configuring searches, and viewing output.
- A set of **tools and wizards** that wrap common workflows (simulation, grid search, model checking, etc.).

The pages in this section give a **task-oriented** tour of the interface.

Each page focuses on how to accomplish a specific set of tasks in the GUI, rather than describing the underlying
algorithms in detail (those are covered in the *Search Algorithms* and *Tests & Scores* sections).
